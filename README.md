Ekşi is a collaborative hypertext "dictionary" based on the concept of Web sites built up on user contribution.However, Ekşi Sözlük is not a dictionary in the strict sense; users are not required to write correct information. It is currently one of the largest online communities in Turkey with over 400,000 registered users.The number of writers is about 54,000. As an online public sphere, Ekşi Sozluk is not only utilized by thousands for information sharing on various topics ranging from scientific subjects to everyday life issues, but also used as a virtual socio-political community to communicate disputed political contents and to share personal views.
